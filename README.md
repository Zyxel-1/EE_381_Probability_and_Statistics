# EE 381 -  Probability and Statistics with Applications to Computing

## Course Description

The course introduces students to concepts of probability theory with an emphasis on computer modeling of probabilistic systems. Topics include random variables and their statistics, probability distributions, Markov chains, Bayesian networks, sampling techniques, hypothesis testing, regression and analytic methods.. The concepts are presented from a mathematical foundation, developed and exemplified with realistic computer simulations using Python.
